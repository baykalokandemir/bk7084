### User Input

Okay, here is some context: This framework is for us to use for our Computational Simulations course, in which we need to make a nice, stylized 3d scene in which there are animations, shaders, agent based movement, and et cetera. We're still in the early stages of the course, so we don't know how much complexity we're going to be able to add, but here is our idea: We import a mesh scene, like a portion of the Night City map from Cyberpunk 2077, and render it using the "Cyberpunk 2077 mikoshi point cloud" style. The style combines two main elements:

    Point Cloud: Graphics where objects and scenes are represented not by traditional meshes (triangles), but by a vast collection of individual points in 3D space. This gives a fragmented, digitized, and abstract appearance.

    Mikoshi/Cyberpunk Aesthetic: The visual language of the Mikoshi server sequence in Cyberpunk 2077—often featuring a digital, glitching, and highly stylized look with a specific color palette (often deep blues, purples, and neon greens/reds) to represent consciousness, data, and digital environments.

Don't implement anything. first, figure out if this is feasible with the current framework. then, if not, tell me what we need to introduce as functionality to this framework

I feel like we can start with simple geometry, achieve the rendering effect, and then start working on importing geometry. with this in mind, extend this implementation roadmap and save it as an .md file.

implement the new functinality into mesh_object, and make a test file to see its effects on the exercises folder.

### User Input

i see one large dot once i run the mikoshi_test file. it gets smaller as i go away, and the color changes. here are the problems i see:

we should be sampling multiple points per surface / shape. this is just one large dot. 

the dots should be much smaller, only resemble the surface in large number of small dots.

Background is white, which is pretty poor for the purposes of the effect.

### User Input

much much nicer! although, still, make the points a bit smaller. also, the points seem to be too regularly spaced, not randomized enough, and they seem to be moving. im not sure if they actually move or if its an artifact though.

this is slightly worse. now, points are moving even faster, and i guess while the size of the points are ok, the number of points are too large.

im not very happy with this. still too many points and a lot of rotation. to clarify, currently, i want no rotation whatsoever
